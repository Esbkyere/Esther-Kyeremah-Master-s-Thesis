```{r}

covfmt_df = janitor::clean_names(covfmt_df)
```

26,211 observations and 139 variables


**Creating smaller dataset with needed information**
```{r}
cov_sub1 = covfmt_df %>% 
select(agegr1n, racen, sexn, ethnicn, edgr1n, incgr1n, covthnk, lbcovrsnas, mar, livsit, livwith, livnum, employ, pabt, covdxyn, prepos, asth, cld, hd, hyp, cayr, immun, hiv, diab, kdrd, livd, scd, obes, mh, subabu, mcoth, mcothsp, pcr_ab_positivity, enrwk, enrwkc, enryr, psu_weight, samplinkfl, base_weight) 
```

Questions: 
Is 5 the category for missing age group. 
was covthnk_decoded asked for adults only?
I dont have access to tthe variable AGED which is the numeric age..why?
